# Toeing the party manifold

Interactive visualization of dimensionality reduction techniques applied to US congressional voting data.

Basic workflow, each step corresponding to a Jupyter notebook:

1. Load/clean/encode congressional voting data and load legislator metainfo.
2. Apply several dimensionality reduction algorithms to the encoded voting data
3. Visualize the embeddings in 2- and 3-dimensions with a Dash app.

A more thorough high-level overview is available here. Low-level details are
explained within the notebooks.
